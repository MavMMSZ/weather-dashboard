# Weather Dashboard Application
## Description/Usage
This application allows you to view a weather forecast through your webpage. All you have to do is type in the name of the city that you would like to see the forcast for and click the "search" button. Once the city has been searched it will display 5 days worth of weather forcasts! You can also continue to search new cities for their forcasts or delete your history for them to keep your screen clean.
